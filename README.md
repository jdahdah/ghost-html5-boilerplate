# Ghost HTML5 Boilerplate Theme

**NOTE: This code is outdated and no longer being maintained.**

A barebones theme for [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/) based on [html5-boilerplate](http://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/). This theme offers a very basic, unstyled output of your Ghost content to give you a head-start with the theme engine, while implementing the structure and best-practices of HTML5-Boilerplate. The theme also borrows some code from the default Ghost theme [Casper](http://github.com/TryGhost/Casper).

Please note that Ghost is in an early development stage and this theme may adapt as Ghost evolves.

## Installing
Download the [latest version](http://github.com/jdahdah/ghost-html5-boilerplate/archive/master.zip) of the Ghost HTML5-Boilerplate Theme and unzip its contents into a folder named whatever you want to call your theme. Put that in the Ghost theme directory:

`[GHOST_DIRECTORY]/content/themes/`

Restart Ghost, then navigate to `Settings` \> `General` in the Ghost admin area. Select your theme from the dropdown menu labeled "Theme" and hit `Save`. Voilà.

## Version
The current master version of Ghost HTML5 Boilerplate is intended for use with **Ghost v0.4 and above** and based html5-boilerplate v4.3.0. Refer to the [releases](http://github.com/jdahdah/ghost-html5-boilerplate/releases) page if you need this theme compatible to an older version of Ghost. Version numbers are matched up to the Ghost release they are compatible with.

## Feedback
Please leave feedback by opening an [issue](http://github.com/jdahdah/ghost-html5-boilerplate/issues) on Github.

## Known Issues
It’s currently not possible in Ghost to implement a CDN for jQuery delivery in the same way it is done in h5bp. The reason is that the system outputs jQuery in the custom tag `{{ghost_foot}}` which must be included in every theme. This is a [known issue](http://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/1181) that may be resolved in a later version of Ghost.
